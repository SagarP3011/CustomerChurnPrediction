# Encryptix_Taskno.1

This repository contains the completed tasks for my internship in Machine Learning at Encryptix. The tasks involved implementing various machine learning models and solving real-world problems. Below are the details of the tasks completed:

## Task 1: Customer Churn Prediction
**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a service) based on their usage data and demographic information.

**Details:**
- Collected and preprocessed customer data.
- Explored various features and their importance in predicting churn.
- Implemented several machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best model and fine-tuned it for better performance.

**Files:**
- Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
-  Jupyter notebook with data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
-  Saved models and other relevant files.
